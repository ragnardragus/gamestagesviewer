This is a mod that adds a new tab in the inventory window where it simply shows the stages of the [Game Stages](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/game-stages) mod you gained, it was also strongly inspired by Reskillable and also offers compatibility with it.

This mod is aimed at creators of Mod Packs to help visualize the stages achieved by the players. The mod has several configurations where it is possible to edit a formatted title for registration and an icon for it.

On the [Wiki](https://github.com/ragnardragus/gamestagesviewer/wiki) it is possible to find out how to configure the stage titles and with the help of the  [Resource Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resource-loader) mod, customize the stage icons and the window where they will be displayed.

Note: Much of the code written was replicated from the [Reskillable](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reskillable) mod, the intent is not to steal code, but to do something that worked as well as what the Reskillable team implemented.

The mod also supports Reskillable and can use both mods together.
